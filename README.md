## Overview
Regression is one of the fundamental techniques in statistical modeling and machine learning. This repository includes:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

The projects are implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks** for Python and **R scripts**, making it easy to follow along and understand the code.

## Technologies Used
The repository is primarily composed of:
- **Jupyter Notebook** (99.2%)
- **R** (0.8%)

## Projects
The repository includes the following projects:
1. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - Demonstrates predicting a continuous variable using one or more explanatory variables.
   - Implemented in Python via Jupyter Notebooks.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Shows binary classification using logistic regression.
   - Implemented in Python and R.

## Setup
### Python Environment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyabesbes/Regression.git
   cd Regression
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### R Environment
1. Ensure R is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary R packages by running the provided scripts.

## Usage
1. Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook or R script.
2. Follow the comments and instructions to understand and execute the regression models.
3. Modify datasets or parameters as needed to experiment with the models.
